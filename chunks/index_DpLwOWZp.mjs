Welcome to the official <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> blog starter template. This
				template serves as a lightweight, minimally-styled starting point for anyone looking to build
				a personal website, blog, or portfolio with Astro.
</p> <p>
This template comes with a few integrations already configured in your
<code>astro.config.mjs</code> file. You can customize your setup with
<a href="https://astro.build/integrations">Astro Integrations</a> to add tools like Tailwind,
				React, or Vue to your project.
</p> <p>Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:</p> <ul> <li>Edit this page in <code>src/pages/index.astro</code></li> <li>Edit the site header items in <code>src/components/Header.astro</code></li> <li>Add your name to the footer in <code>src/components/Footer.astro</code></li> <li>Check out the included blog posts in <code>src/content/blog/</code></li> <li>Customize the blog post page layout in <code>src/layouts/BlogPost.astro</code></li> </ul> <p>
Have fun! If you get stuck, remember to <a href="https://docs.astro.build/">read the docs
